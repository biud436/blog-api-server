# Introduction

## How to setup library

before starting the library that can set configuration files such as `.env`, you must run the following command:

```bash
nest build env
```

and then next you run the following command:

```bash
yarn start env
```

Note that this command does not support a feature that can reset for each line after reading a file named `.env`.

## Upgrade package

```bash
yarn upgrade --pattern @nestjs --latest
```
